This repo provides a simple tool to migrate all UserVoice tickets to Zendesk using official APIs from Uservoice and Zendesk

How to use:
1) Create a legacy user for import, and input the id in zendesk_config.py in addition to other Zendesk credentials
2) Add in Uservoice credentials to uservoice_config.py
3) You are off to the races!

A lot of to dos: refactor for clarity, add user import, and fix double-first comment/description
